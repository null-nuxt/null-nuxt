/**
 * Fields are reactive state. Declared at module scope they are created once per
 * process, so on the server the second request drives the same objects the
 * first one filled in — one user's data showing up in another's form.
 *
 * The types can't see this: whether `fields()` runs at module scope or inside a
 * factory is not something a signature can express. So it is caught at runtime,
 * and caught on the condition that IS the bug rather than on a proxy for it.
 *
 * "Was there an active effect scope when the fields were created?" is the
 * obvious check and the wrong one: it fires in tests and in any helper that
 * builds fields before handing them over, neither of which leaks anything. What
 * actually leaks is one fields object driving two forms — so that is what's
 * detected, at the moment it happens.
