 * drive what the first one filled in. An inert object has nothing to leak, so
 * the failure stops existing rather than being warned about.
 *
 * Construction happens inside the setup, in `index.ts`. The guarantees stay in
 * the constructor: `refFields` still rejects an option whose value doesn't
 * match its field's.
